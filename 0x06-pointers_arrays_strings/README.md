This is all about arrays, points and strings.

Some tasks we looked at included the following:

0.strca: Write a function that concatenates two strings.
1. strncat: Write a function that concatenates two strings.
  -Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
  -The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes

2. strncpy: Write a function that copies a string.
3. strcmp: Write a function that compares two strings
4. Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
  -Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n); Where n is the number of elements of the array
5. Always look up: Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what come: Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody: Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.
